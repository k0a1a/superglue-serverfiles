# allow Superglue!
iptables -A input_rule -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

# allow SSH (rescue mode)
iptables -A input_rule -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Internal uci firewall chains are flushed and recreated on reload, so
# put custom rules into the root chains e.g. INPUT or FORWARD or into the
# special user chains, e.g. input_wan_rule or postrouting_lan_rule.
